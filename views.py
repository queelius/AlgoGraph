Lazy graph views for efficient filtering and querying.

This module provides view classes that enable lazy evaluation of graph
operations without copying data. Views are particularly useful for large
graphs where creating subgraphs would be expensive.

Inspired by Python's dict_keys/dict_values views and database query views.
